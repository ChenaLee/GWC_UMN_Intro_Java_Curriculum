## Counting from Zero - Zero Based Numbering
Did you notice this is marked as lesson **00** intead of **01**?  
In programming, most of times countring and numbering starts from *Zero*.  
It's a convention among mathematicians and computer scientists.   

### Exercise 1
> Lined up with a group of classmates.  
>  
>  Line: | A | B | C | D | You | E | F  
> -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --
> Non-programmers | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7
> Programmers | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6  
>  
> You are at position 4, not 5!  

## So what is Programming? 
### Analogy 1
* Let's assume in **Human** only speaks **English**. But can easily learn **Spanish** if they try. Learning **Chinese** is much more difficult.  
* **google translator** only knows show to convert **Spanish** into **Chinese**.  
* **Computer** only speaks **Chinese**.  
* **Programmers** are people who learned how to speak Spanish. Even though they think in English, they can write in Spanish.  

Then they would do the following to communicate.  
**English** > Write > Instruction in **Spanish** > Google Translate > Instruction in **Chinese**
 
Equivalent of this in technological terms is:  
**Natural Language** > Coding/Programming > **Code in High Level Programming Language** > Compiler Compiles > **Machine Code**

When we say "running a program", it's like giving the instruction in Chinese you have to the computer so the computer can do what it is told to do.

There are many programming languages you can use to make **Code in High Level Programming Languages**. One of the most popular ones is **Java**, which you will learn and use throughout the class.
