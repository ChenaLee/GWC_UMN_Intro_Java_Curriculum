kind of like arrow

### Comparison in Programming
Then how do we say two things are equal in programming?  
== sign  

## Mathematical Operators
Addition uses "+". e.g. 1+2  
Subtracion uses "-". e.g. 2-1  
Multiplication uses "*". e.g. 2*3  
Division uses "/". e.g. 1/2  

## Learn And Exercises
### Recap: Create a class in the project you created from lesson 0 in the same way.
Review lesson 0 if this is difficult.

### Exercise 0 : Two variables with different types.
1. In main function, create an int type variable named *number* with value 1. Print it. Try running it!  
2. Follwing 1, create a double type variable named *doubleNumber* with value 1.3. Print it. Try running it!  

### Exercise 1 : Changing values in a variable.
1. Change the value of *number* with  

### Exercise 2 : Two variables with imcompatible values.
1. Create another int type variable named "anotherNumber* with value 2.3. Print it. Try running it! What happened?  
2. Create another double type variable named "anotherDoubleNumber* with value 2. Print it. Try running it! What happened?  

### Exercise 3 : Addition and Subtraction
1. 
2.
3. Re-assignment of variable x = x+1  

### Exercise 4 : Multiplication and Division



exercise4: save it number+anotherNumber to a double, number+doubleNumber to int,
Challege: By re-using only one variable called "myNumber" and a string, print your age, , then your age
Challenge2: something about char and string..
